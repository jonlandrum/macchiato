# Macchiato â˜•

A Java program that keeps your computer awake. It works in one of two ways:

* By occassionally entering a (generally) inocuous key (F15), or
* By occassionally moving the mouse pointer slightly (one pixel)

As it is impossible to predict every user's requirements, both options are included in the settings. The application
defaults to the key press option. And because this is a Java application, almost all platforms are supported.
