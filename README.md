# Macchiato â˜•

A C++/Qt program that keeps your computer awake. It works in one of two ways:

* By occasionally entering a (generally) innocuous key stroke (F15), or
* By occasionally moving the mouse pointer slightly (one pixel over and then back to start)

As it is impossible to predict every user's requirements, both options are included in the settings; the default is the
key press option. And because this program utilizes the Qt framework, almost all desktop platforms are supported.
